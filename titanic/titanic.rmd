Let's explore the titanic dataset from kaggle and import tidyverse.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
BASEPATH = "~/kaggle/EDA/titanic"
setwd(BASEPATH)

data <- read_csv('data/train.csv')
cat(str(data))
```
We have 891 unique passengers, and the response that we are looking to predict with the features is 'Survived'. While a little morbid, let's look at a pie chart of who survived.
```{r pie}
title: survived | (light blue w/ count), not survied(dark blue)
```
